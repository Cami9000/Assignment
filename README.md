# 🚗 Insurance Purchase Prediction - Deep Learning Model  

This project builds a deep learning model to predict whether a customer will buy another insurance policy based on their profile.  
We use **PyTorch** to train a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** model on a large dataset with **11 million rows**.
